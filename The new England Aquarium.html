                <h5> New England Aquarium</h5>
               <h3> A WORLD BELOW THE SURFACE.</h3>

                  A major attraction on the Boston waterfront, the New England Aquarium (NEAQ) faced
                large crowds<br> and found itself ill-equipped for the massive lines packing in visitors
                like sardines. Tourists and <br>residents alike were trying to access information about
                NEAQ through their mobile devices, but due<br> to an outdated site, they were unable to
                do so without frustration.<br><br>
               The NEAQ wanted to create an efficient and simple digital platform for local tourists and
                visitors, and<br> so they looked to DOMANI to build a mobile site that would help users plan a
                visit and guide them <br>while on site at the aquarium.

            As a mobile-only project, we were focused intensely on the user experience and journey, and optimizing
            the site<br> across all handheld devices and connectivity options. We rebuilt the entire mobile site from the
            ground up; from <br>immersive stakeholder interviews to internal database integration, we left no stone unturned.<br><br>

            We developed an intuitive mobile experience, stripping away all superfluous features to give users a seamless
            and<br> worry-free family trip. Potential visitors can tap to call the aquarium, check out the daily schedule,
            purchase tickets<br> and memberships, and even browse the exhibit and animal guide before they get there. And
            if you’re already at the<br> aquarium, a custom menu points you to a digital scavenger hunt for kids, maps,
            real-time events, and more.<br><br>

            With bold, exciting, and dare we say cuddly visuals, the new NEAQ mobile site makes users fall in love with
            the<br> animals first, which in turn drives interest and membership in the long run
