                      In today’s Internet Age where everything is shareable and potentially viral,
                      us designers constantly come across<br>
                      new things that inspire us to push past boundaries in our work.
                      Yet, how do you make sure that your project is<br>
                      not just visually fresh but actually works for your target user?<br>
                      How do you get a user to embrace new UX and UI patterns without sacrificing
                      the experience and functionality?<br><br>

                      Here are four questions to ask yourself before you follow a trend:
                      <br><br><br><br></p>
                  <h2>1. IS IT RIGHT FOR THE PROJECT?</h2><br>
                      <p>Just because we see it everywhere – and even if it becomes a common
                          UX pattern – that doesn’t mean it’s right<br>
                          for the project.
                          A perfect example is the controversial hamburger menu. It’s commonplace and creates an<br>
                          aesthetically pleasing interface. Yet, it can hamper
                          discoverability and leave the user feeling alienated. By fully<br>
                          understanding conversion goals and breadth of content,
                          it will become clear whether following this trend is <br>appropriate.

                          The Danish Shipowners Association’s <a href="#"> Navigating Responsibility </a>,
                          for example, uses a hamburger nav because<br>
                          their experience is exploratory. Users primarily navigate their content by scrolling down the<br>
                          page, so having the navigation constantly visible is not needed.
                          They’ve also very cleverly adapted this common pattern to <br>
                          complement the interaction in their desktop experience where
                          screen real estate is not at a premium.</p><br><br>

                      <h4>Navigating Responsibility Desktop Site</h4>
                  </div>
                  <div class="txt2">
                      <h2>2. HOW WILL THIS AFFECT METRICS AND PERFORMANCE?</h2><br><br>
                      <p>
                          Metrics and performance indicators are table stakes for all clients,
                          just as page load time and page weights are<br>
                          important to the user. Parallax scrolling is a great example
                          of how a brilliant storytelling tool, which used <br>
                          appropriately on sites like  <a href="#"> The Boat</a>, may negatively impact SEO, make for<br>
                          a poor user experience (especially for mobile users) with long page load times,
                          and even  <a href="#"> cause motion sickness</a>! A deep understanding of what<br>
                          devices will be used most, type and length of content, as well
                          as the how metrics may be impacted will help you<br>
                          decide what’s right for the experience you are designing.

                  <div class="txt3">
                      <h2>3. HAS MY USER ENCOUNTERED THIS TREND BEFORE?</h2><br><br>
                      <p>
                          The keyword here is MY user. Of course you’ve seen
                          this pattern and your colleagues have too, otherwise it<br>
                          wouldn’t be considered a trend. But, if your target user
                          hasn’t and you don’t provide refined microinteractions <br>
                          and implement appropriate error prevention, it’ll all be
                          for naught. Creating strong user personas based on<br>
                          research and interviews will help you empathize with your user,
                          get into their mindset, and fully understand the<br>
                          UX and UI patterns they are comfortable with.
                          Before launching the site for  <a href="#"> R+Co</a>, we worked hard to<br>
                          get to know the end user to determine their needs and understand
                          what an enriching experience means to them. We<br>
                          implemented defined microinteractions to guide the user
                          through the horizontal scroll. The result is an<br>
                          engaging, immersive visual experience, that echoes the
                          attitude and style of these rule-bending hairstylists.<br>

                      <h4>R+Co Desktop Site</h4><br><br>
                  </div>
                  <div class="txt4">
                      <h2>4. WHAT DOES MY USER ACTUALLY THINK OF THIS?</h2><br>
                      <p>
                          The only way to find out if the trend in question will
                          work for your user is to test and test and test. Testing at<br>
                          lower fidelities early and often provides validation and
                          highlights issues. And interestingly enough, this can<br>
                          actually help you be a trendsetter as opposed to just a follower,
                          since you’ll be in a pattern of finding newer and<br>
                          better solutions. Really allowing yourself to experience
                          things through the user’s eyes can lead you to uncover a<br>
                          new, innovative solution or pattern. The recently refreshed  <a href="#"> Google
                          Fonts</a> is a lovely example of understanding<br>
                          and researching the users needs and developing a product
                          that was, as you know, welcomed with open <br>
                          (I’m a huge fan!). Take a peek into  <a href="#"> their process</a>.

                      <p>Ultimately, trends come and go, but if you keep the user’s goal as
                          focal point, you’ll know best what to<br>
                          implement and you’ll be that much further in creating
                          an effective and memorable experience.<br><br>

                          Jerry Cao at UXPin  <a href="#"> says it best</a>: “Trends are nothing more
                          than additional tools in your designer toolbox. Always<br>
                          pick the right ones for the job.”</p><br><br><br><br>
